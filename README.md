## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Methodology BEM

### What I learned

I learned a lot about the background in this project, as I had to move with more than 1 background and know how to position it in different places using the "vw" and "vh" units.

Using variables in CSS was interesting, even being a simple project, they help and make the code prettier. I believe that when dealing with pages of various themes they will be very useful
